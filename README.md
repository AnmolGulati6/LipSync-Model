## Overview
LipSync leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze and decode lip movements in video sequences. By processing frames and extracting relevant features, the model predicts the spoken words, providing a text transcription of the lip movements.

## Features
- Accurate lip-reading using deep learning models.
- Video preprocessing and frame extraction.
- Text transcription from lip movements.
- Integration with TensorFlow for model training and inference.

## Installation

To get started with LipSync, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnmolGulati6/LipSync.git
    cd LipSync
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the necessary data:
    - You can download the data from [this link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YlvpDLix3S-U8fd-gqRwPcWXAXm8JwjL).
    - Extract the data into the `data` directory.

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:
    ```python
    import os

    # Ensure the data is in the correct directory structure
    os.listdir('data/alignments/s1')
    ```

2. Train the model:
    ```python
    # Load and preprocess the data
    train_data = load_data('data/train')
    test_data = load_data('data/test')

    # Train the model
    model.fit(train_data, validation_data=test_data, epochs=100)
    ```

3. Run inference:
    ```python
    sample = load_data('data/sample_video.mp4')
    yhat = model.predict(sample)

    # Decode the predictions
    decoded = tf.keras.backend.ctc_decode(yhat, input_length=[75], greedy=True)[0][0].numpy()
    print('Predicted text:', decoded)
    ```
